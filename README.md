# hplib - heat pump library
Repository with code to 
- build a **database** with relevant data from public Heatpump Keymark Datasets
- identify **efficiency parameters** from the database with regression models  
- **simulate** heat pump efficiency and electrical & thermal power as time series.

The following columns are available for every heat pump of this library

Further more, based on this library four generic heat pumps with an average efficieny where created
- air/water | onoff
- air/water | inverter
- brine/water | onoff
- brine/water | inverter

## Input-Data
The European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) hosts a webiste with the results of laboratory measurements from the keymark certification process. For every heat pump model a pdf file can be downloaded from https://keymark.eu/en/products/heatpumps/certified-products.

This repository is based on all pdf files that were download for every manufacturer on 2021-03-12.

## Setup & Pre-Processing
First of all, you are free to download new keymark-files and process them with the following processing steps. The requirements are:
- clone this repository, e.g. `https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib-database.git`
- change into the new directiory and setup an environment with `conda create --name hplib-database --file requirements.txt`
- put your pdf files into the folder `input/pdf`
- unix: *pdftotext* is included in many linux distributions | windows: install xpdf https://www.xpdfreader.com/
- run the unix bash script `./input/pdf2text.sh` or replace this step with an appropriate tool on windows/mac which converts pdf files to simple textfiles. For windows try 

## Usage of hplib

### create database
The main processing uses python / pandas to parse the text files and find the relevant data. It creates a dataframe and saves its content to `output/data_key.csvÂ´
- first run `1_create_database.ipynb`



### fit efficiency parameters

In this database every measurement point has a input temperature, a output temperature and the thermal and electric power. From this data for every heatpump three graphs are fittet with the formula: 
Pth(Tin,Tout)=k1\*Tin+k2\*Tout+k3 and Pel(Tin,Tout)=k4\*Tin+k5\*Tout+k6 and COP(Tin,Tout)=k7\*Tin+k8\*Tout+k9. The parameters are saved in the `data_key_para.csv`.
  
-for this run `2_fit_parameters.ipynb`


### simulate a heat pump

To use these parameters you need to get the functions from `simulate.ipynb` and give a input temperature, output temperature and the model name. 
In those functions effects like a negative electrical value are neglected and a suplementary heater is defined. In return you get the Thermal Power, the electrical power, the electrical power of the suplementary heater and the COP as a list.
- there are some examples in `simulate.ipynb`
