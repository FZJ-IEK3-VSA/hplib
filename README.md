# hplib - heat pump library

Repository with code to
 
- build a **database** with relevant data from public Heatpump Keymark Datasets
- identify **efficiency parameters** from the database with a least-square regression model  
- **simulate** heat pump efficiency (COP) as well as electrical (P_el) & thermal power (P_th) and massflow (m_dot) as time series.

For the simulation, it is possible to calculate outputs of a **specific manufacturer + model** or alternatively for one of **6 different generic heat pump types**. 

## Documentation

If you're interested in how the database and parameters were calclulated, have a look into the Documentation [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib/blob/main/docs/documentation.html) or [Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib/blob/main/src/documentation.ipynb). There you also find a **simulation examples** and a **validation**.

## Usage

Download or clone repository:

`git clone https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib.git`

Create the environment:

`conda env create --name hplib --file requirements.txt`

Create some code with `import hplib` and use the included functions `load_database`, `get_parameters` and `simulate`.

## Heat pump models and Group IDs
The hplib_database.csv contains the following number of heat pump models, sorted by Group ID

| [Group ID]: Count | Reglulated | On-Off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Outdoor Air / Water | [1]: 366 | [4]: 23 |
| Brine / Water | [2]: 54 | [5]: 53 |
| Water / Water | [3]: 0 | [6]: 10 |

## Input-Data and further development
The European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) hosts a website with the results of laboratory measurements from the keymark certification process. For every heat pump model a pdf file can be downloaded from https://keymark.eu/en/products/heatpumps/certified-products.

This repository is based on all pdf files that were download for every manufacturer on 2021-03-12.

**Further development | Possibilities to collaborate**

- Extend hplib.py and hplib_database.csv for cooling functionality 
- Make hplib installable via `pip`
