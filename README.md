# hplib - heat pump library

Repository with code to
 
- build a **database** with relevant data from public Heatpump Keymark Datasets.
- identify **efficiency parameters** from the database with a least-square regression model, comparable to Schwamberger [1].  
- **simulate** heat pump efficiency (COP) as well as electrical (P_el) & thermal power (P_th) and massflow (m_dot) as time series.

For the simulation, it is possible to calculate outputs of a **specific manufacturer + model** or alternatively for one of **6 different generic heat pump types**.

## Documentation

If you're interested in how the database and parameters were calclulated, have a look into the Documentation [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib/blob/main/docs/documentation.html) or [Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib/blob/main/docs/documentation.ipynb). There you also find a **simulation examples** and a **validation**.

## Usage

- Get repository with pip:
  - `pip install hplib`

or: 

- Download or clone repository:
  - `git clone https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/hplib.git`
  - Create the environment:
    - `conda env create --name hplib --file requirements.txt`

Create some code with `from hplib import hplib` and use the included functions `hplib.load_database()`, `hplib.get_parameters`, `hplib.same_built_type()`,  `hplib.HeatPump`, `hplib.HeatPump.simulate`, `hplib.HeatingSystem.calc_brine_temp()` and `hplib.HeatingSystem.calc_heating_dist_temp()`


**Hint:** The csv files in the `output` folder are for documentation and validation purpose. The code and database files, which are meant to be used for simulations, are located in the `hplib` folder.

## Input-Data
The European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) hosts a website with the results of laboratory measurements from the keymark certification process. For every heat pump model a pdf file can be downloaded from https://keymark.eu/en/products/heatpumps/certified-products.

This repository is based on all pdf files that were download for every manufacturer on 2021-03-12.
