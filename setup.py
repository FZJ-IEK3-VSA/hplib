setup(
    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install name
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name="hplib",  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    # For a discussion on single-sourcing the version across setup.py and the
    # project code, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/single_source_version.html
	# Reset to 0.0.0 when starting a new project, as this version number is the version of
	# the template itself!
    version="1.2.0",  # Required

    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
    description="",  # Optional

	# This should be your name or the name of the organization which owns the
    # project.
    author="RE-Lab",  # Optional

    # This should be a valid email address corresponding to the author listed
    # above.
    author_email='re-lab@hs-emden-leer.de',  # Optional

    # This should be a valid link to your project's main homepage.
    url="https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/RE-Lab_template",  # Optional

    # Examples listed include a pattern for specifying where the package tracks
    # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
    #project_urls={  # Optional
    #    "Bug Reports": "https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/RE-Lab_template/issues",

	# #########################
	# The following option don't need to be changed
    # This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
    # the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
    #
    # The long discreption is the contents of the README.md
    long_description=long_description,  # Optional
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",  # Optional (see note above)


    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.
    # `src/`, it is necessary to specify the `package_dir` argument.
    package_dir={"": "src"},  # Optional
    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(where="src"),  # Required
    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. If you
    # do not support Python 2, you can simplify this to '>=3.5' or similar, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires=">=3, <4",
    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    #
    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    install_requires=[],  # Optional
    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
    #
    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # projects.
    extras_require={"dev": [], "test": []},  # Optional
    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.
    #
    # If using Python 2.6 or earlier, then these have to be included in
    # MANIFEST.in as well.
    # package_data={  # Optional
    #     'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    # },
    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    #
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    # data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file'])],  # Optional
    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    # entry_points={  # Optional
    #     'console_scripts': [
    #         'sample=sample:main',
    #     ],
    # },
    # List additional URLs that are relevant to your project as a dict.
    #
    # This field corresponds to the "Project-URL" metadata fields:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#project-url-multiple-use
